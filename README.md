# Subtitles player

Application allowing user to learn language with the help of his favourite podcasts and videos.   
Usage can be divided into four steps:

- User selects a file from your pc or dragging link from youtube
- Application generates subtitles using [VoskAPI](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api)

- User can enjoy watching the video and save at any given time a combination of translated to user's language and
  original chunks to learn later
